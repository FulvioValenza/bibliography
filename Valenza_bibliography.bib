  abstract  = {Usually network administrators implement a protection policy by refining a set of (abstract) communication security requirements into configuration settings for the security controls that will provide the required protection. The refinement consists in evaluating the available technologies that can enforce the policy at node and network level, selecting the most suitable ones, and possibly making fine adjustments, like aggregating several individual channels into a single tunnel. The refinement process is a sensitive task which can lead to incorrect or suboptimal implementations, that in turn affect the overall security, decrease the network throughput and increase the maintenance costs. In literature, several techniques exist that can be used to identify anomalies (i.e. potential incompatibilities and redundancies among policy implementations. However, these techniques usually focus only on a single security technology (e.g. IPsec) and overlook the effects of multiple overlapping protection techniques. This paper presents a novel classification of communication protection policy anomalies and a formal model which is able to detect anomalies among policy implementations relying on technologies that work at different network layers. The result of our analysis allows administrators to have a precise insight on the various alternative implementations, their relations and the possibility of resolving anomalies, thus increasing the overall security and performance of a network. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Network Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Networks paradigms try to overcome these limitations by allowing more flexibility, configurability and agility. Unfortunately, the problem of deciding which security services to use, where to place and how to configure them is a multidimensional problem that has no easy solution. This paper provides a model that can be used to determine the best allocation for the security applications needed to satisfy the user requirements while minimizing the cost for the network operator, subject to the different constraints expressed by the involved actors. This model can be exploited to pursue an initial dimensioning and set-up of the system infrastructure or to dynamically adapt it to support the user security policies. Initial validation shows that allocations generated with our model have considerable advantages in terms of costs and performance compared to traditional approaches. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract={Network function virtualization (NFV) is a new networking paradigm that virtualizes single network functions. NFV introduces several advantages compared to classical approaches, such as the dynamic provisioning of functionality or the implementation of scalable and reliable services (e.g., adding a new instance to support demands). NFV also allows the deployment of security controls, like firewalls or VPN gateways, as virtualized network functions. However, currently there is not an automatic way to select the security functions to enable and to configure the selected ones according to a set of user's security requirements. This paper presents a first approach towards the integration of network and security policy management into the NFV framework. By adding to the NFV architecture a new software component, the Policy Manager, we provide NFV with an easy and effective way for users to specify their security requirements and a process that hides all the details of the correct deployment and configuration of security functions. To perform its tasks, the Policy Manager uses policy refinement techniques. © 2015 IEEE.},

 abstract={Security risk management and mitigation are two of the most important items on several companies' agendas. In this scenario, software attacks pose a major threat to the reliable execution of services, thus bringing negative effects on businesses. This paper presents a formal model that allows the identification of all the attacks against the assets embedded in a software application. Our approach can be used to perform the identification of the threats that loom over the assets and help to determine the potential countermeasures, that is the protections to deploy for mitigating the risks. The proposed model uses a Knowledge Base to represent the software assets, the steps that can be executed to mount an attack and their relationships. Inference rules permit the automatic discovery of attack step combinations towards the compromised assets that are discovered using a backward programming methodology. This approach is very usable as the attack discovery is fully automatic, once the Knowledge Base is populated with the information regarding the application to protect. In addition, it has been proven highly efficient and exhaustive. © 2015 IEEE.},

In order to reduce the complexity of the network configuration, administrators have leveraged network policies, introducing hence new possibility of error. Indeed, erroneous and unexpected network behaviour (e.g., security flaws) can derive from the wrong network policy definition, but also from the possible anomalies among policies of different domains. This paper presents a formal model for detecting inter-and intra-domain policy anomalies. Policy anomalies allow administrators to identify all the network behaviours they consider erroneous or to be monitored. To validate the generality of the proposed solution, the model has been applied to three policy domains (packet filtering, communication protection and service function chaining) and the impact of an anomaly detection analysis was tested in different sized networks. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract={Network architectures and applications are becoming increasingly complex. Several approaches to automatically enforce configurations on devices, applications and services have been proposed, such as Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM). However, the management of enforced configurations in production environments (e.g. data center) is a crucial and complex task. For example, updates on firewall configuration to change a set of rules. Although this task is fundamental for complex systems, few effective solutions have been proposed for monitoring and managing enforced configurations. This work proposes a novel approach to monitor and manage enforced configurations in production environments. The main contributions of this paper are a formal model to identify/generate traffic flows and to verify the enforced configurations; and a slim and transparent framework to perform the policy assessment. We have implemented and validated our approach in a virtual environment in order to evaluate different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the prototype is effective and has good performance, therefore our model can be effectively used to analyse several types of IT infrastructures. A further interesting result is that our approach is complementary to PBNM.  © 2016 ACM.},

  abstract={In recent years, several important initiatives have appeared worldwide, aimed at bringing significant innovation in industrial networked systems (INSs). As an example, the Industry 4.0 and Factory of the Future frameworks are paving the way to modern intelligent factories, where issues such as the communication complexity between smart devices and system on-the-fly reconfiguration are dealt with in efficient and cost-effective manner. However, global connectivity also implies constant increase of cyber threats targeting industrial systems, so security must be considered since the very beginning when new appealing solutions need to be conceived. In this paper, we exploit the innovative Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to introduce improvements in managing the network infrastructure of INSs, as this can help in reducing the management costs and complexity. In particular, enhanced SDN functionalities are adopted, which are able to provide security support in additions to their native switching/routing functionalities. The paper also shows how this approach can overcome some limitations of many current INS security architectures. The feasibility of the proposed solution is confirmed by the development of a simple laboratory prototype based on commodity hardware, and used to obtain some preliminary evaluation of the achievable functionality and performance benefits. © 2017 IEEE.},

This paper presents a novel approach to quantify network reachability based on the concept of equivalent firewall – a fictitious device, ideally connected directly to the communicating peers and whose policy summarizes the network behaviour between them – that can be queried to derive reachability information. We build equivalent firewalls by using a mathematical model that supports a large variety of network security controls (like NAT, NAPT, tunnels and filters up to the application layer) and allows an accurate analysis.

abstract={The recent years have witnessed a growth in the number of users connected to computer networks, due mainly to megatrends such as Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and Smart Grids. Simultaneously, service providers started offering vertical services related to a specific business case (e.g., automotive, banking, and e-health) requiring more and more scalability and flexibility for the infrastructures and their management. NFV and SDN technologies are a clear way forward to address these challenges even though they are still in their early stages. Security plays a central role in this scenario, mainly because it must follow the rapid evolution of computer networks and the growing number of devices. The main issue is to protect the end-user from the increasing threats, and for this reason, we propose in this paper a security framework compliant to the Security-as-a-Service paradigm. In order to implement this framework, we leverage NFV and SDN technologies, using a user-centered approach. This allows to customize the security service starting from user preferences. Another goal of our work is to highlight the main relevant challenges encountered in the design and implementation of our solution. In particular, we demonstrate how significant is to choose an efficient way to configure the Virtual Network Security Functions in terms of performance. Furthermore, we also address the nontrivial problem of Service Function Chaining in an NFV MANO platform and we show what are the main challenges with respect to this problem. © 2019 Ignazio Pedone et al.},

This paper addresses the above-mentioned problem by presenting a framework designed for automatically extracting verification models starting from an abstract representation of a given network function. Using guidelines provided in this paper, vendors can describe the forwarding behavior of their network function in developer-friendly, high-level languages, which can be then translated into formal verification models of different verification tools. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract={Access control is one of the building blocks of network security and is often managed by network administrators through the definition of sets of high-level policies meant to regulate network behavior (policy-based management). In this scenario, policy refinement and verification are important processes that have to be dealt with carefully, possibly relaying on computer-aided automated software tools. This paper presents a comprehensive approach for access control policy refinement, verification and, in case errors are detected in the policy implementation, their fixing. The proposed methodology is based on a twofold model able to describe both policies and system configurations and allows, by suitably processing the model, to either propose a system configuration that correctly enforces the policies, or determine whether a specific implementation matches the policy specification also providing hints on how possible anomalies can be fixed. Results on the average complexity of the solution confirm its feasibility in terms of computation time, even for complex networked systems consisting of several hundred nodes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={The virtualization of applications and network functions facilitates the dynamic creation of compound services, automating both the provisioning of computing/networking/storage resources and their life-cycle management. Virtualization of security appliances is a common approach to protect such services, but can neither offer broad visibility across the whole deployed service nor implement coordinated and fine-grained enforcement actions. This paper proposes a novel security framework based on the integration of lightweight and programmable monitoring and enforcement hooks in each virtual function, which are collectively controlled by a common logic for prevention, detection, reaction, and mitigation of security threats. Our framework keeps direct control over the functionalities of the security hooks, and leverages standard orchestration tools for management actions on the service graph. It can be automatically instantiated by common orchestration operations, hence seamlessly integrating with the deployment process of service graphs. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Automated policy-based network security management tools represent a new research frontier to be fully explored, so as to reduce the number of human errors due to a manual and suboptimal configuration of security services. Moreover, the agility that an automated tool would require can be provided by the most recent networking technologies, Network Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Networking, which move the network management from the hardware level to the software. However, even though a Security Automation approach is nowadays feasible and would bring several benefits in facing cybersecurity attacks, pending problems are that currently only a limited number of automatic management tools have been developed and that they do not have a direct integration with cloud orchestrators, consequently requiring human interaction. Given these considerations, in this paper we propose a novel framework, whose goal is to automatically and optimally allocate and conFigure security functions in a virtualized network service in a formal and verified way, directly integrated in cloud orchestrators. We validated this contribution through an implementation that is able to cooperate with two well-known orchestrators, that are Open Baton and Kubernetes. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper introduces an approach toward the automatic enforcement of security policies in network functions virtualization (NFV) networks and dynamic adaptation to network changes. The approach relies on a refinement model that allows the dynamic transformation of high-level security requirements into configuration settings for the network security functions (NSFs), and optimization models that allow the optimal selection of the NSFs to use. These models are built on a formalization of the NSF capabilities, which serves to unequivocally describe what NSFs are able to do for security policy enforcement purposes. The approach proposed is the first step toward a security policy aware NFV management, orchestration, and resource allocation system - a paradigm shift for the management of virtualized networks - and it requires minor changes to the current NFV architecture. We prove that our approach is feasible, as it has been implemented by extending the OpenMANO framework and validated on several network scenarios. Furthermore, we prove with performance tests that policy refinement scales well enough to support current and future virtualized networks. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

While network operators need to check network configurations as soon as possible, the SDN verification literature focuses on checking policy correctness during or after their deployment. This paper, instead, proposes early verification of forwarding policies before their deployment, by looking for the presence of anomalies that can potentially lead to erroneous and unexpected network behaviour. The proposed verification relies on a formal model that enables high flexibility in specifying both a forwarding policy and the set of anomalies to verify.

abstract={Distributed systems are extremely difficult to design and implement correctly because they must handle both system correctness and device failures. Most of the work focuses on the first aspect, and in particular, on the correctness of security and network configuration. The large demand for availability and reliability for critical services is actually pushing new architectures that tolerate faults, but a-priori analysis of redundancy and recovery features is still limited. To this end, we present a framework to design and formally verify the persistence of network properties, even in case of failures. The solution considers both nodes and links failure, and it is based on a formal model that takes both network topology and network device configurations into account. In contrast, most of the existing approaches only consider network topology. By analyzing the formal model, the framework can check whether the specified network services are still available after failures, and in case of success, it outputs a possible configuration of the devices to be used for automatic recovery. © 2020 IEEE.},

Most notably, the entire traffic matrix is designed to be configured using simple high-level rules, clearly stating who can talk to whom according to the service abstraction adopted by SOME/IP. Three incremental security levels are made available, accounting for different services being associated with different requirements. The core security protocol, encompassing a session establishment phase followed by the transmission of secured SOME/IP messages, has been formally verified, to prove its correctness in terms of authentication and secrecy properties.

In particular, even though network management has become more flexible, the increased complexity of virtual networks is making manual operations unfeasible and leading to errors which open the path to a large number of cyber attacks. A possible solution consists in reaching a trade-off between flexibility and complexity, by automatizing the configuration of the channel protection systems through policy refinement. In view of these considerations, this paper proposes a preliminary study for an innovative methodology to automatically allocate and configure channel protection systems in virtualized networks.

 abstract={The massive shift to ‘‘virtualization’’ paradigms has largely transformed the traditional computing models, by progressively eroding the typical strong link between applications and devices, hence requiring to rethink and reshape the structure and composition of services and infrastructures. On the one hand, the continuous disaggregation between the software and the hardware facilitates the migration of applications and services to different infrastructures. On the other hand, the growing ‘‘softwarization’’ trend allows the creation and disposal of even complex execution environments in a matter of minutes or seconds instead of days or weeks; this includes the provisioning of (virtual) computing and networking resources, the retrieval of software images, the processing of large data sets and the connection to an ever-growing Internet of Things. The undergoing evolution has also fostered a ground-breaking transition in design and development patterns, from monolithic applications and closed silos to open and interconnected service meshes, which leverage cloud models, common interfaces, and orchestration paradigms. Pragmatic examples of such architectures in the networking domains are Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN), which has not only brought more flexibility in network management, but has also opened new perspectives and opportunities in the realization of large, distributed, and pervasive cyber–physical systems. However, this has also determined an increase in the networks’ size and complexity, not to mention the security dependency on external software, services, data and infrastructures. The management of network devices has become more difficult than in the past, and the number of vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a cyberattack is nowadays bigger as well. Unfortunately, cyber-security paradigms have not evolved at the same pace. As a matter of fact, the ‘‘security perimeter’’ model is still the predominant paradigm, but it cannot effectively address the many issues related to multi-tenancy, increased complexity, automated lifecycle management. Although cloud management and orchestration software is already mature for the market, many enterprises are reluctant to adopt such technologies due to security concerns, which still imply more traditional (and longer) processes. For instance, network services can today be designed as the composition of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), including resource constraints, and then automatically deployed over self-provisioning virtualized infrastructures. VNFs can be rapidly turned on and set up, with respect to what a hardware device was used to require in the past. However, there are not as much fast security processes for checking software images, hardening an ever evolving topology, give visibility over functions running in external infrastructures. A new breed of cyber-security paradigms and models are therefore necessary that could address the increased complexity and size of modern systems, not to mention the rapid escalation of advanced persistent threats and multi-vector attacks. Beyond more advanced techniques based on Machine Learning and other forms of Artificial Intelligence that could effectively cope the ever evolving threat landscape and attack patterns, it is also important to address the growing dynamicity of modern computing paradigms, self-provisioning models, service-oriented architectures, shared resources and software-defined infrastructures. This special issue of Elsevier Computer Networks fostered new research work that took into consideration security challenges brought by the usage of public cloud, heterogeneous infrastructures and providers, and dynamic software deployment and orchestration mechanisms. The scope is not limited to a single topic, but covers several aspects that fall under the aforementioned evolutionary perspective. To this end, after the two successful SecSoft workshops1 that deal with these fields, we selected the best papers from these editions to invite the authors for submission of an extended paper for peer review and potential publication in this special issue.},

    abstract={Network virtualization increased the versatility in
enforcing security protection, by easing the development of
new security function implementations. However, the drawback
of this opportunity is that a security provider, in charge of
configuring and deploying a security function graph, has to
choose the best virtual security functions among a pool so large
that makes manual decisions unfeasible. In light of this problem,
the paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing virtual
security services by introducing the functionality abstraction.
This new level of abstraction allows to work in the virtual level
without considering the different function implementations, with
the objective to postpone the function selection jointly with the
deployment, after the configuration of the virtual graph. This
novelty enables to optimize the function selection when the pool
of available functions is very large. A framework supporting
this approach has been implemented and it showed adequate
scalability for the requirements of modern virtual networks},

  abstract = {The increased flexibility and interconnectivity of modern industrial communication networks, obtained through the use of innovative technologies like network function virtualization and software-defined networking, require a secure and manageable framework to support the new communication and computing needs. To focus on these requirements, this article proposes a framework for reliable placement of services across physically separated locations, which offers both system optimization, in terms of latency and resource utilization, and connectivity policy enforcement to guarantee service reliability, safety, and security. This is achieved by exploiting a new approach to solve the virtual network embedding problem, using optimization modulo theories (MaxSMT), which allows the use of very expressive constraints. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The configuration of security functions in computer
networks is still typically performed manually, which likely
leads to security breaches and long re-configuration times.
This problem is exacerbated for modern networks based on
network virtualization, because their complexity and dynamics
make a correct manual configuration practically unfeasible. This
article focuses on packet filters, i.e., the most common firewall
technology used in computer networks, and it proposes a new
methodology to automatically define the allocation scheme and
configuration of packet filters in the logical topology of a virtual
network. The proposed method is based on solving a carefully
designed partial weighted Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theories problem 
by means of a state of the art solver. This approach
formally guarantees the correctness of the solution, i.e., that
all security requirements are satisfied, and it minimizes the
number of needed firewalls and firewall rules. This methodology
is extensively evaluated using different metrics and tests on both
synthetic and real use cases, and compared to the state-of-the-art
solutions, showing its superiority. © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={The pervasiveness of Internet of Things (IoT) has made the management of computer networks more troublesome. The
softwarized control provided by Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is not sufficient to overcome the problems raising in
this context. An increasing number of attacks can, in fact, occur in SDN-aware IoT networks if the security configuration
enforced on the SDN switches is manually computed and not formally verified. To mitigate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel methodology which leverages Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theories (MaxSMT) to automatically
compute a formally correct and optimized allocation scheme and configuration of SDN switches by refining security
policies, user-defined or derived from detected attacks. This mechanism is compliant with the main characteristics of
virtualized IoT-based networks, such as the simultaneous presence of numerous interconnected devices and strict latency
requirements. The feasibility and the performance of the framework developed to implement this methodology have
been validated in a realistic use case.},

  abstract={The revolution that Industrial Control Systems are undergoing is reshaping the traditional
network management and it is introducing new challenges. After the advent of network virtualization,
an enhanced level of automation has been required to cope with the safety-critical mission of industrial
systems and strict requirements for end-to-end latency. In the literature, there have been attempts to
automatically solve two strictly interconnected problems for the management of virtual industrial networks:
the Virtual Network Function embedding and the time-sensitive flow scheduling problems. However, dealing
with these problems separately can lead to unoptimized results, or in the worst case to situations where the
latency requirements cannot be satisfied because of a poorly chosen function embedding. In light of these
motivations, this paper proposes a formal approach to jointly solve the two problems through an Optimization
Satisfiability Modulo Theories formulation. This choice also allows combining two vital features: a formal
guarantee of the solution correctness and optimization targeting the minimization of the end-to-end delay for
flow scheduling. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been validated by implementing a prototype
framework and experimentally testing it on realistic use cases.},
