  abstract  = {Usually network administrators implement a protection policy by refining a set of (abstract) communication security requirements into configuration settings for the security controls that will provide the required protection. The refinement consists in evaluating the available technologies that can enforce the policy at node and network level, selecting the most suitable ones, and possibly making fine adjustments, like aggregating several individual channels into a single tunnel. The refinement process is a sensitive task which can lead to incorrect or suboptimal implementations, that in turn affect the overall security, decrease the network throughput and increase the maintenance costs. In literature, several techniques exist that can be used to identify anomalies (i.e. potential incompatibilities and redundancies among policy implementations. However, these techniques usually focus only on a single security technology (e.g. IPsec) and overlook the effects of multiple overlapping protection techniques. This paper presents a novel classification of communication protection policy anomalies and a formal model which is able to detect anomalies among policy implementations relying on technologies that work at different network layers. The result of our analysis allows administrators to have a precise insight on the various alternative implementations, their relations and the possibility of resolving anomalies, thus increasing the overall security and performance of a network. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract  = {Network operators face several limitations in terms of infrastructure management and costs when trying to offer security services to a large number of customers with current technologies. Network Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Networks paradigms try to overcome these limitations by allowing more flexibility, configurability and agility. Unfortunately, the problem of deciding which security services to use, where to place and how to configure them is a multidimensional problem that has no easy solution. This paper provides a model that can be used to determine the best allocation for the security applications needed to satisfy the user requirements while minimizing the cost for the network operator, subject to the different constraints expressed by the involved actors. This model can be exploited to pursue an initial dimensioning and set-up of the system infrastructure or to dynamically adapt it to support the user security policies. Initial validation shows that allocations generated with our model have considerable advantages in terms of costs and performance compared to traditional approaches. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract={Network function virtualization (NFV) is a new networking paradigm that virtualizes single network functions. NFV introduces several advantages compared to classical approaches, such as the dynamic provisioning of functionality or the implementation of scalable and reliable services (e.g., adding a new instance to support demands). NFV also allows the deployment of security controls, like firewalls or VPN gateways, as virtualized network functions. However, currently there is not an automatic way to select the security functions to enable and to configure the selected ones according to a set of user's security requirements. This paper presents a first approach towards the integration of network and security policy management into the NFV framework. By adding to the NFV architecture a new software component, the Policy Manager, we provide NFV with an easy and effective way for users to specify their security requirements and a process that hides all the details of the correct deployment and configuration of security functions. To perform its tasks, the Policy Manager uses policy refinement techniques. © 2015 IEEE.},

 abstract={Security risk management and mitigation are two of the most important items on several companies' agendas. In this scenario, software attacks pose a major threat to the reliable execution of services, thus bringing negative effects on businesses. This paper presents a formal model that allows the identification of all the attacks against the assets embedded in a software application. Our approach can be used to perform the identification of the threats that loom over the assets and help to determine the potential countermeasures, that is the protections to deploy for mitigating the risks. The proposed model uses a Knowledge Base to represent the software assets, the steps that can be executed to mount an attack and their relationships. Inference rules permit the automatic discovery of attack step combinations towards the compromised assets that are discovered using a backward programming methodology. This approach is very usable as the attack discovery is fully automatic, once the Knowledge Base is populated with the information regarding the application to protect. In addition, it has been proven highly efficient and exhaustive. © 2015 IEEE.},

In order to reduce the complexity of the network configuration, administrators have leveraged network policies, introducing hence new possibility of error.

This paper presents a formal model for detecting inter-and intra-domain policy anomalies. Policy anomalies allow administrators to identify all the network behaviours they consider erroneous or to be monitored. To validate the generality of the proposed solution, the model has been applied to three policy domains (packet filtering, communication protection and service function chaining) and the impact of an anomaly detection analysis was tested in different sized networks. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract={Network architectures and applications are becoming increasingly complex. Several approaches to automatically enforce configurations on devices, applications and services have been proposed, such as Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM). However, the management of enforced configurations in production environments (e.g. data center) is a crucial and complex task. For example, updates on firewall configuration to change a set of rules. Although this task is fundamental for complex systems, few effective solutions have been proposed for monitoring and managing enforced configurations. This work proposes a novel approach to monitor and manage enforced configurations in production environments. The main contributions of this paper are a formal model to identify/generate traffic flows and to verify the enforced configurations; and a slim and transparent framework to perform the policy assessment. We have implemented and validated our approach in a virtual environment in order to evaluate different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the prototype is effective and has good performance, therefore our model can be effectively used to analyse several types of IT infrastructures. A further interesting result is that our approach is complementary to PBNM.  © 2016 ACM.},

Indeed, no effective protection scheme can abstract from the careful design of access control policies, and infrastructures underlying modern Industrial Networked Systems (INSs) are not exceptions from this point of view.

The proposed approach enables the description of both positive and negative AC policies, by applying the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) paradigm to typical INS implementations, while taking into account different levels of abstraction. Suitable techniques are adopted to check whether or not policies are correctly implemented in the system (verification). When conflicts are detected, possible (re)assignments of credentials to the system users are automatically computed, that can be adopted to correct anomalies (conflict resolution). © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract={In recent years, several important initiatives have appeared worldwide, aimed at bringing significant innovation in industrial networked systems (INSs). As an example, the Industry 4.0 and Factory of the Future frameworks are paving the way to modern intelligent factories, where issues such as the communication complexity between smart devices and system on-the-fly reconfiguration are dealt with in efficient and cost-effective manner. However, global connectivity also implies constant increase of cyber threats targeting industrial systems, so security must be considered since the very beginning when new appealing solutions need to be conceived. In this paper, we exploit the innovative Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to introduce improvements in managing the network infrastructure of INSs, as this can help in reducing the management costs and complexity. In particular, enhanced SDN functionalities are adopted, which are able to provide security support in additions to their native switching/routing functionalities. The paper also shows how this approach can overcome some limitations of many current INS security architectures. The feasibility of the proposed solution is confirmed by the development of a simple laboratory prototype based on commodity hardware, and used to obtain some preliminary evaluation of the achievable functionality and performance benefits. © 2017 IEEE.},

Reachability analysis – the process that evaluates allowed communications – is a tool useful not only to discover security issues but also to identify network misconfigurations. This paper presents a novel approach to quantify network reachability based on the concept of equivalent firewall – a fictitious device, ideally connected directly to the communicating peers and whose policy summarizes the network behaviour between them – that can be queried to derive reachability information. We build equivalent firewalls by using a mathematical model that supports a large variety of network security controls (like NAT, NAPT, tunnels and filters up to the application layer) and allows an accurate analysis. The presented approach is efficient and highly scalable, as confirmed by tests with a large corporate network as well as synthetic networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The recent years have witnessed a growth in the number of users connected to computer networks, due mainly to megatrends such as Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and Smart Grids. Simultaneously, service providers started offering vertical services related to a specific business case (e.g., automotive, banking, and e-health) requiring more and more scalability and flexibility for the infrastructures and their management. NFV and SDN technologies are a clear way forward to address these challenges even though they are still in their early stages. Security plays a central role in this scenario, mainly because it must follow the rapid evolution of computer networks and the growing number of devices. The main issue is to protect the end-user from the increasing threats, and for this reason, we propose in this paper a security framework compliant to the Security-as-a-Service paradigm. In order to implement this framework, we leverage NFV and SDN technologies, using a user-centered approach. This allows to customize the security service starting from user preferences. Another goal of our work is to highlight the main relevant challenges encountered in the design and implementation of our solution. In particular, we demonstrate how significant is to choose an efficient way to configure the Virtual Network Security Functions in terms of performance.

However, the increasing complexity of the services and the management of very large scale environments drastically complicate detecting alerts and configuration errors of the network components. Nowadays, misconfigurations can be identified using formal analysis of network components for compliance with network requirements. Unfortunately, formal specification of network services requires familiarity with discrete mathematical modeling languages of verification tools, which requires extensive training for network engineers to have the essential knowledge. This paper addresses the above-mentioned problem by presenting a framework designed for automatically extracting verification models starting from an abstract representation of a given network function.

This paper presents a comprehensive approach for access control policy refinement, verification and, in case errors are detected in the policy implementation, their fixing. The proposed methodology is based on a twofold model able to describe both policies and system configurations and allows, by suitably processing the model, to either propose a system configuration that correctly enforces the policies, or determine whether a specific implementation matches the policy specification also providing hints on how possible anomalies can be fixed.

Virtualization of security appliances is a common approach to protect such services, but can neither offer broad visibility across the whole deployed service nor implement coordinated and fine-grained enforcement actions. This paper proposes a novel security framework based on the integration of lightweight and programmable monitoring and enforcement hooks in each virtual function, which are collectively controlled by a common logic for prevention, detection, reaction, and mitigation of security threats. Our framework keeps direct control over the functionalities of the security hooks, and leverages standard orchestration tools for management actions on the service graph.

abstract={Automated policy-based network security management tools represent a new research frontier to be fully explored, so as to reduce the number of human errors due to a manual and suboptimal configuration of security services. Moreover, the agility that an automated tool would require can be provided by the most recent networking technologies, Network Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Networking, which move the network management from the hardware level to the software. However, even though a Security Automation approach is nowadays feasible and would bring several benefits in facing cybersecurity attacks, pending problems are that currently only a limited number of automatic management tools have been developed and that they do not have a direct integration with cloud orchestrators, consequently requiring human interaction. Given these considerations, in this paper we propose a novel framework, whose goal is to automatically and optimally allocate and conFigure security functions in a virtualized network service in a formal and verified way, directly integrated in cloud orchestrators. We validated this contribution through an implementation that is able to cooperate with two well-known orchestrators, that are Open Baton and Kubernetes. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper introduces an approach toward the automatic enforcement of security policies in network functions virtualization (NFV) networks and dynamic adaptation to network changes. The approach relies on a refinement model that allows the dynamic transformation of high-level security requirements into configuration settings for the network security functions (NSFs), and optimization models that allow the optimal selection of the NSFs to use. These models are built on a formalization of the NSF capabilities, which serves to unequivocally describe what NSFs are able to do for security policy enforcement purposes. The approach proposed is the first step toward a security policy aware NFV management, orchestration, and resource allocation system - a paradigm shift for the management of virtualized networks - and it requires minor changes to the current NFV architecture. We prove that our approach is feasible, as it has been implemented by extending the OpenMANO framework and validated on several network scenarios. Furthermore, we prove with performance tests that policy refinement scales well enough to support current and future virtualized networks. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the proposed management strategies for SDN networks is to specify traffic forwarding through policies, where each policy rule identifies a traffic flow and its traversed service chains. While network operators need to check network configurations as soon as possible, the SDN verification literature focuses on checking policy correctness during or after their deployment. This paper, instead, proposes early verification of forwarding policies before their deployment, by looking for the presence of anomalies that can potentially lead to erroneous and unexpected network behaviour. The proposed verification relies on a formal model that enables high flexibility in specifying both a forwarding policy and the set of anomalies to verify. The presented approach is efficient and highly scalable, as confirmed by tests with large networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Distributed systems are extremely difficult to design and implement correctly because they must handle both system correctness and device failures. Most of the work focuses on the first aspect, and in particular, on the correctness of security and network configuration. The large demand for availability and reliability for critical services is actually pushing new architectures that tolerate faults, but a-priori analysis of redundancy and recovery features is still limited. To this end, we present a framework to design and formally verify the persistence of network properties, even in case of failures. The solution considers both nodes and links failure, and it is based on a formal model that takes both network topology and network device configurations into account. In contrast, most of the existing approaches only consider network topology. By analyzing the formal model, the framework can check whether the specified network services are still available after failures, and in case of success, it outputs a possible configuration of the devices to be used for automatic recovery. © 2020 IEEE.},

The configuration of firewalls is mainly done by network administrators, thus, it suffers from human errors.

We propose a novel framework, called ArgoFiCo, which is based on argumentation reasoning.

This paper formalizes a novel framework proposed to provide improved security to the emerging SOME/IP middleware, without introducing at the same time limitations in the communication patterns available. Most notably, the entire traffic matrix is designed to be configured using simple high-level rules, clearly stating who can talk to whom according to the service abstraction adopted by SOME/IP. Three incremental security levels are made available, accounting for different services being associated with different requirements. The core security protocol, encompassing a session establishment phase followed by the transmission of secured SOME/IP messages, has been formally verified, to prove its correctness in terms of authentication and secrecy properties. Performance-wise, in-depth experimental evaluations conducted with an extended version of vsomeip confirmed the introduction of quite limited penalties compared to the bare unsecured implementation. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Data confidentiality, integrity and authentication are security properties which are often enforced with the generation of secure channels, such as Virtual Private Networks, over unreliable network infrastructures. Traditionally, the configuration of the systems responsible of encryption operations is performed manually. However, the advent of software-based paradigms, such as Software-Defined Networking and Network Functions Virtualization, has introduced new arms races. In particular, even though network management has become more flexible, the increased complexity of virtual networks is making manual operations unfeasible and leading to errors which open the path to a large number of cyber attacks. A possible solution consists in reaching a trade-off between flexibility and complexity, by automatizing the configuration of the channel protection systems through policy refinement. In view of these considerations, this paper proposes a preliminary study for an innovative methodology to automatically allocate and configure channel protection systems in virtualized networks. The proposed approach would be based on the formulation of a MaxSMT problem and it would be the first to combine automation, formal verification and optimality in a single technique. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={In order to achieve the highest safety integrity levels, ISO26262 recommends the use of formal methods for various verification activities, throughout the lifecycle of safety-related embedded systems for road vehicles. Since formal methods are known to be difficult to use, one of the main challenges raised by these ISO26262 requirements is to find cost-effective approaches for being compliant with them. This paper proposes an approach for requirements formal verification where formal methods, languages, and tools are only minimally exposed to the user, and are integrated into one of the commonly used system modeling environments based on SysML. This approach does not require particular expertise in formal methods still allowing to apply them. Hence, personnel training costs and development costs should be kept limited. The proposed approach has been implemented as a plugin of the Topcased environment. Although it is limited to discrete system models, it has been successfully experimented on an industrial use case. © 2019 Karabuk University},
